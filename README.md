- 👋 Hi, I’m @disnel-fonoma
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend and backend technologies. I use Drupal/Wordpress for backend and Nextjs for the frontend, I like to develop decoupled web sites using the mentioned CMSs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular so I can have a new perspective.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on NextJs engagements.
- 📫 You can reach me at disnel@fonoma.com.
